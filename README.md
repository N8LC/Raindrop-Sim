# Raindrop-Sim
This simulation is a unique project that I developed with the intention of working with neural networks. 
Essentially, this project is designed to model rain droplets as they fall through a windy area. It does
this by having a grid of 64 different squares in which each square enacts a vector force on a droplet.

## How it works
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14dec961-c303-4eb1-b3d9-1801907d7a89)

Each color on the wheel indicates the angle of the vector. As we can see here, the colors of the 
vectors are mapped to the angle of the vector force applied to a droplet. Then, the force of the 
droplet is shown by how bright the color is or the opacity of the color.
