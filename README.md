# Raindrop-Sim
This simulation is a unique project that I developed with the intention of working with neural networks. 
Essentially, this project is designed to model rain droplets as they fall through a windy area. It does
this by having a grid of 64 different squares in which each square enacts a vector force on a droplet.
